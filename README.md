# üåê Overview
RASP is a technology that is embedded within application and kicks in when an application starts and runs. It's designed to detect attacks on an application runtime. When an application begins to run, RASP can protect it from malicious input or behaviour by analysing both, the app's behaviour, and the context of that behaviour. By using the application to continuously monitor its own behaviour, attacks can be identified and mitigated immediately without human intervention.

### üîë Key Features

- **Proactive Threat Detection:** Detect and react to security events during application runtime with configurable incident response features.
- **Collecting Security Events:** Integrate RASP to collect security events on the server side, providing insights into detected security events.
- **Security Events Visibility:** App Protector Portal SDK offers real-time information about detected security events, aiding in monitoring and quick reactions.
- **PSD2 Compliance:** Meet regulatory requirements for mobile applications handling payment transactions with self-protecting data.
- **Minimal Performance Impact:** Smooth implementation with no downtime, source code changes, false positives, or performance overhead.

### App Protector Portal
App Protector portal is only available with the full App Protector version.

Android App Protector SDK is written in Java language but is fully compatible with other Java languages supported on Android, like Kotlin. This framework can be used for target devices from Android KitKat (API level 19) and higher.

For iOS, there are two builds, build for SWIFT and build for Objective-C. Both versions have all the capabilities in terms of runtime self-protection. This framework can be used for target devices from iOS 8.0 and higher.

App Protector SDK collects and sends security events from mobile applications to App Protector Portal. Portal can be used for analysing security events/attacks on user‚Äôs devices which have installed monitored production application. Based on received information, behaviour of App Protector (RASP configuration) can be changed. Changing configuration or responses on attacks can be done by sending change information over App Protector Portal server to App Protector SDK on mobile device.

App Protector Portal is a solution that enables clients to create RASP configuration for each user and mobile application. Using this solution, clients will be able to set which attack App Protector SDK online should detect and choose which response will be created after attack is detected. App Protector SDK online collects data of detected attacks and sends it to Portal. Based on the inputs from the SDK, client will be able to see statistics for each platform, Android and iOS.
